# Speed 2048
A small clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).
A branch of [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048).

Timers will be added for each new block formed in order to facilitate speed competitions.

Made just for fun. [Play it here!](http://galoompa.github.io/Speed2048/) (Link may not be working).
